This cube-shaped cactus has been on my wishlist for years!  I was thrilled to see it for sale at [Miles2Go.com](http://miles2go.com/). The name is a mouthful: *Astrophytum myriostigma var. quadricostatum*. The typical form of *A. myriostigma* has 5 ribs, but this variation has only 4 (at least for now; over time it's likely that it may grow more). For now, I'm thoroughly enjoying the unusual shape and the bright yellow blossoms perched on top!
